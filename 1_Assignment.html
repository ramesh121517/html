            <div class="answer">
                <p>No, HTML tags and elements are different. Tags are used to mark up the beginning and end of an
                    element, whereas an element includes the opening tag, content, and closing tag.
                    <br>Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and
                    everything in between.
                    On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of
                    an element, as you can see in the above illustration.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content. HTML attributes are
                    used to describe
                    the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.
                </p>
                <p>Tags are used to create HTML elements, while attributes provide additional information about an
                    element. Attributes are included within the opening tag and modify the behavior or appearance of
                    the

            <div class="answer">
                <p> void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or
                    text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.
                    <br>In HTML, a void element must not have an end tag.
                </p>
                <p>Void elements are HTML elements that do not have closing tags and do not contain content. Examples
                    include <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</p>

                <p>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a
                    semicolon (;). HTML
                    entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as
                    HTML code), and
                    invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use HTML character entities in place
                    of other
                    characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly
                    used to point to
                    a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make
                    changes to HTML
                    elements with a specified class.

                <p> The basic difference between ID and Class is that the ID selector is applied only to one element in

                <p>The 'id' attribute is unique and can only be used once on a page, while 'class' can be used multiple times and applied to many elements.</p>
