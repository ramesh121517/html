    <h1>How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. It is a
        combination of Hypertext and Markup language. HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how
        to properly display the content on the screen. So, in this article, we will learn how to embed audio and video
        in HTML. In order to insert multimedia files on web pages, we already know how to insert images in HTML. </p>
    <code>
    <audio>
        <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
    </audio>
    </code>
    <pre>
        Attribute          Value            Description
        autoplay          autoplay          When the page is loaded. It specifies to play audio as soon as possible. 
        controls          controls          It displays audio control. 
        loop               loop             It will start the audio again when it is finished. 
        muted              muted            When the page is loaded audio will be automatically muted.

    </pre>
    <p>video tag</p>
    <pre>
        The HTML video element is used to show a video on a web page.
        The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
        It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
        The source element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
        The text between the video tag and video tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the video element.
    </pre>
    <!-- video tag -->
    <video height="" width="">
        <source src="video link path" type="video file 3mp ">
    </video>

    <h1>Semantic element in HTML5?</h1>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span tags - Tells nothing about its content.
        Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article tags - Clearly defines its content.</p>
    <p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: div id ,div class and div id="footer" to indicate navigation, header, and
        footer.
        In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: </p>

    <p>article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, main, mark, nav, section, summary, time, tags </p>
